### What We Did Today

- Initialized Poetry for dependency management; resolved version conflicts.
- Built and debugged Dockerfile; successfully ran backend and PostgreSQL containers.
- Installed missing dependencies (`pdf2image`, `opencv-python`) inside Docker.
- Fixed Python indentation errors causing crashes.
- Verified backend is running on Uvicorn, database is connected.
- Confirmed Docker containers running without critical errors.

### Current Status

- Backend and database containers running.
- Backend ready to serve APIs.
- Frontend code is ready but not yet integrated.
- User auth and DB integration pending.
- PDF-to-DOCX conversion backend modules implemented but need integration.

### Next Steps

- Connect frontend to backend API endpoints.
- Implement user account management and authentication.
- Add email verification flow.
- Continue refining Docker and Poetry configurations.
- Begin writing tests (unit and integration).
- Optimize deployment workflows.

### Notes

- To start containers on return, run:  
  `docker compose up`  
  from project root.
- Use Poetry inside backend directory for dependencies:  
  `poetry install`
- Keep watch for new errors or missing packages.
