1. Structure your frontend for scalability
Even with plain HTML/CSS (no big frameworks yet), organize your files clearly:

Separate folders for styles, scripts, and HTML templates/pages.

Use reusable components (e.g., header, footer) included via server-side includes or JS.

Plan your page flow: login, registration, main dashboard, single processing, batch processing, payment, profile.

2. Design UI with your user journey in mind
Authentication pages (login/signup) need form validation & error feedback.

After login, show a dashboard with clear access to:

Single file processing (free)

Batch processing (paid, with clear call-to-action for upgrade)

For batch processing:

Allow users to upload multiple files or zipped folders.

Show progress/status of batch jobs.

Include profile/account page to manage subscription/payment info (even if just a placeholder).

3. Plan for API integration early
Even if you don’t write JS now, structure your UI elements so it’s easy to later add API calls with fetch() or a library like Axios.

Use semantic HTML with IDs/classes that make selecting elements for JS easy.

Example: <form id="login-form">, <div id="batch-status">.

4. Prepare for authentication token handling
After login, you’ll get a JWT or token from backend.

Plan to store this token securely (e.g., in localStorage or cookies with httpOnly flag when you add JS).

All protected API calls will need this token in headers.

Even with minimal JS, keep placeholders or comments where this will plug in.

5. UI/UX for paid features
Clearly differentiate free vs. paid features.

Show upgrade prompts or disable batch UI elements for free users.

Show error messages or modal dialogs when unauthorized users try batch processing.

Later, add payment workflow (Stripe Checkout or custom UI).

6. Responsive and accessible design
Make sure your UI works on different screen sizes.

Use basic accessibility principles (labels on inputs, focus states).

This makes it easier to improve and maintain later.

7. Error and success feedback
Every user action should have clear feedback:

Loading states (e.g., "Processing... please wait")

Success messages ("File processed successfully!")

Error messages ("Batch processing requires subscription.")

8. Keep security in mind
Never expose sensitive info in frontend code.

Validate all user inputs on backend as well.

Plan to use HTTPS when deployed.
