# User Creation Feature - Testing Plan

## 1. Input Validation & Security
- [ ] Validate proper email format; reject invalid emails.
- [ ] Enforce password rules: minimum length, complexity (uppercase, number, special char).
- [ ] Reject duplicate user creation (same email or username).
- [ ] Validate required fields are present and correct types.
## 8. Email Verification (Optional Future Feature)

### Workflow
1. **User Registration**  
   - User submits signup info (name, email, password).  
   - User record is created with a field `is_verified = False`.

2. **Generate Verification Token**  
   - Generate a unique, time-limited verification token (e.g., UUID or JWT).  
   - Store the token linked to the user or encode user info in the token.

3. **Send Verification Email**  
   - Email user a verification link containing the token.  
   - The link points to an API endpoint (e.g., `/verify-email?token=...`).

4. **Verification Endpoint**  
   - User clicks the link, hitting the endpoint.  
   - The backend verifies the token: checks validity, expiry, matches user.  
   - On success, sets `is_verified = True` on user record.

5. **Post-Verification**  
   - Optionally redirect user to a confirmation page or login page.  
   - Prevent login or limit access if `is_verified` is `False`.

### Additional Considerations
- Implement token expiry and renewal logic.  
- Support resending verification emails.  
- Ensure security: tokens must be hard to guess and expire.  
- Handle edge cases (invalid or expired tokens).  
- Update API docs and test all flows thoroughly.

Would you like help drafting code skeletons for this workflow? Or a sample email template?  
Or would you prefer to first update the plan with this outline and then proceed step-by-step?

## 2. Data Integrity & Persistence
- [ ] Confirm all fields (name, email, hashed password, timestamps) are saved in DB.
- [ ] Verify password is hashed before saving, never stored or returned as plaintext.
- [ ] Check timestamps (`created_at`, `last_logon`) are accurate and well-formatted.

## 3. Security Considerations
- [ ] Confirm strong password hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
- [ ] Verify password is never included in API responses.
- [ ] Test for protections against brute force or spam (rate limiting).

## 4. Error Handling & Responses
- [ ] Validate correct HTTP status codes for errors (e.g., 422, 409).
- [ ] Check error messages are informative but donâ€™t leak sensitive info.
- [ ] Ensure consistent error response format.

## 5. API Usability
- [ ] Test all CRUD operations for users (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- [ ] Verify OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation is accurate and complete.

## 6. Edge Cases
- [ ] Test optional fields missing or null.
- [ ] Validate behavior with large inputs or borderline invalid data.

## 7. Performance & Scalability
- [ ] Simulate multiple simultaneous user creation requests.
- [ ] Ensure safe and efficient DB transactions under load.

# Next Steps

Begin with **1. Input Validation & Security**:
- Define validation rules.
- Test using valid and invalid inputs.
- Handle duplicate entries gracefully.
